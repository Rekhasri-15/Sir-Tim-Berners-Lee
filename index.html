            In 2001, he became Fellow of Royal Society and in 2004, he was knighted.<br><br>In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Laboratory of Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston. It was made up of companies that wanted to work together to create Web Standards and also improve the Web. It was quickly agreed that the technology should be free of royalties and patents. Berners-Lee has served as director of this W3C since it was founded.

            In 1995, Microsoft produced the first version of Internet Explorer and this commercial browser created enormous growth in websites and web users.
